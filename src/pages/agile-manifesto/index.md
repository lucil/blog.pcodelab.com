As one of the early independent signatories, I want the first post of this blog to be about the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
Through my career it has been an inspiration and for a long time the background of my laptop.

It's [twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) are in my opinion one the best ways to craft quality software.
My favourite one: "Working software is the primary measure of progress."

This is what the Manifesto states:

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

A big "Thank you guys" to the [authors](https://agilemanifesto.org/authors.html).
